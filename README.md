# Meyer-Wallach-Entangling
This algorithm defines a way to find the entanglement of a multiple-qubit system


A difficulty with many entanglement measures is that they do not directly correspond
to the outcome of a set of observables on the state. It has been shown that with a small
number of identical copies of a state, one can measure quantum entanglement between two
systems without prior knowledge of the state. For more than two systems, most entanglement measures require knowledge of the state itself, which involves performing quantum state
tomography. For a state residing in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, this means a minimum
of d^2 measurements for each statistical sample must be made on the system. It would be
advantageous, especially for long spin chains, to have an easily measured quantity
of multi-qubit entanglement. Meyer and Wallach have proposed a multi-qubit entanglement measure that was derived as a formal function on many-qubit states but has a simple
physical interpretation. They introduce a function on pure states of n qubits defined as, Q(|Ïˆ>)
